/**

 A queue is a list where you can only insert new items at the back and remove items from the front. This ensures that the first item you enqueue is also the first item you dequeue. First come, first serve!
 
 Why would you need this? Well, in many algorithms you want to add objects to a temporary list at some point and then pull them off this list again at a later time. Often the order in which you add and remove these objects matters.
 
 A queue gives you a FIFO or first-in, first-out order. The element you inserted first is also the first one to come out again. It's only fair!
